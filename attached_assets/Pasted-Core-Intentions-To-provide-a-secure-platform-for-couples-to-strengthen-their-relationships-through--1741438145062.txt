To add a new partner, they must first remove the current one (simulating a breakup).

Both users are notified of the breakup.

Once ended, both users return to “Single” status and can add new partners.

Actionable Suggestions:

The AI provides tailored advice based on user input.

Suggestions may include communication exercises, date ideas, or coping strategies.

6. Conflict Resolution
Purpose: Mediate conflicts between couples without revealing private information from either party.

Features:
Separate Communication Channels for Each Partner:

The AI communicates individually with each partner to gather perspectives on conflicts.

Example questions from the AI:

“How would you like things to improve?”

AI Analysis of Combined Data (Anonymized):

The AI uses inputs from both partners to identify common pain points without revealing specific details from either side.

Encouraging open communication about specific topics.

Notes for Development
Privacy First Approach
Your app must prioritize user privacy at every step—this is critical given its sensitive nature as a relationship tool.
Recommendations include end-to-end encryption for chats and anonymizing data before analysis by the AI system.

AI Model Selection
Use an advanced natural language processing model (e.g., GPT-based models) fine-tuned on psychotherapy techniques and relationship counseling datasets for accurate advice generation.

UI/UX Design
Focus on creating an emotionally engaging yet professional interface that users feel comfortable interacting with during sensitive moments.

Legal Compliance
Ensure compliance with global data protection laws like GDPR (Europe) and CCPA (California). Include clear terms of service and privacy policies explaining how user data is handled.

Testing Phase
Conduct rigorous beta testing with diverse user groups to refine features based on real feedback before launch.
